		Hello and welcome to my GitHub homepage!<br><br>A little about me: My name is Adam Greenspan and I am currently a junior at Tufts University. I am a Political Science major, focused primarily on American Politics. Academically, I also pursue Computer Science and Spanish. At the moment, I am studying in Madrid, Spain with CIEE<br><br> While I've transplanted to Somerville for college, I was born and raised in Dallas, Texas, and I remain a proud Texan. In my spare time, I help coordinate campaign activities for the Tufts Democrats, as well as organize events like the one we put on last November about campaign technology, featuring representatives from NGP VAN, ActBlue, and Hillary for America. I also am an avid ballroom dancer, enjoy going to Hillel events, and, when my schedule permits it, I am a jazz tromboninst in the Tufts Jazz Orchesta.<br><br>Now in my third year at Tufts, I have taken classes in data structures, discrete math, and web programming related to my interest in computer science. Professionally, I hope to combine my interest in political and computer science by exploring the intersection of politics and technology. This includes but is not limited to various campaign technology, data and digital campaign work, and government software.<br><br>Please feel free to email me at agreenspan24@gmail.com

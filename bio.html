<h1>Bio:</h1>

<p>
	My name is Adam Greenspan and I am a junior at Tufts University. I major in Political Science and minor in Computer Science. I was born and raised in Dallas, Texas. Now in my third year at Tufts, I have taken classes in data structures, discrete math, and web programming related to my interest in computer science. In my spare time, I enjoy ballroom dancing, playing jazz trombone, going to Hillel events, and participating in politics. Professionally, I wish to explore the intersection of politics and technology, such as data and digital campaign operations and government software.

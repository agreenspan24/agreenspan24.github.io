	<p id = 'bio'>
		Hello and welcome to my GitHub homepage!<br><br>

		A little about me: My name is Adam Greenspan and I am currently a senior at Tufts University. I am a Political Science major, focused primarily on American Politics. Academically, I also pursue Computer Science and Spanish, which culminated in a recent semester in Madrid, Spain.

		<br><br> 

		While I've transplanted to Somerville for college, I was born and raised in Dallas, Texas, and I remain a proud Texan. I recently finished working for for NGP VAN Inc., engineering products that help political campaigns and non-profits use data and organizing systems to achieve their goals. In my spare time, I help coordinate campaign activities for the Tufts Democrats, such as organizing phone banks, panels, and events. I also am an avid ballroom dancer, enjoy going to Hillel events and rock climbing. When my schedule permits it, I am also a jazz tromboninst in the Tufts Jazz Orchesta.

		 <br><br>

		Now in my fourth year at Tufts, I have taken classes in cybersecurity, web programming, and algorithms, among others related to my interest in computer science. Professionally, I hope to combine my interest in computer science with the kinds of exciting management, organizing, and engagement opportunities provided by my work in the political and government realm.<br><br>

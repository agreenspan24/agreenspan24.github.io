In Assignment 1, I have successfully implemented the three pages, and added a stylesheet. It also includes one jpg, as well as this readme file. While I had occasional trouble pushing to git, the process seems to be figured out and working. I received some help from Yotam Bentov in the process, specifically with linking my cs webpage with my github.io webpage. I spent approximately 5 hours on this project, spaced out over the last week. It should be noted that, while most of my resume and bio is real, some is fictitious. Also, I briefly used a separate file called resumestyle.css, but decided to consolidate all my css work into one file (style1.css).
